## Contents of Repository
This repository contains the code and documentation for replicating a study investigating whether it is possible to predict the primary types of different Pokemon based on the hex color codes found in their graphic images. This repository contains a README file, LICENSE file, MATERIALS folder, PROMPT/DELIVERABLES file, RUBRIC file. 

## Section 1: Hook and Rubric Documents
The hook document outlines the case study and is titled CS3Prompt.pdf. The Rubic, titled CS3Rubric.pdf outlines the expected formatting, submission, and final deliverables for this case study. Both documents should be referenced to have a successful final submission.

## Section 2: Materials
The Materials folder contains the image and text based datasets, including the training and testing sets used in the example. The folder also contained Rmd scripts displaying a method for extracting color palettes from images and building a random forest model for primary type prediction. Additionally, this folder contains two reference materials to use gaining greater understanding of both Pokemon Types and the Pokemon Design Process.
